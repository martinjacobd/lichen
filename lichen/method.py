"""How Lichen puts a typed question to a model and reads the answer.

One question becomes one chat prompt: the state, the question, and its answers
as labels (letters for a choice, Yes/No for a noul, digits for a score). The
answer is the softmax of the next-token logits over those labels. `Method`
holds the options that change how the question is put:

system          The system message. `SYSTEM + GUARD` adds that the state is data,
                and that instructions inside it are not to be followed.
permute         Ask a choice once for each rotation of its option order and
                average the probabilities by option. Small models favour an
                option for its place in the list: gemma-4-E4B gave one option
                about 0.3 more probability when it was listed first.
repeat          Put the state and question in the user message this many times.
                A causal model reads the state before it reaches the question; a
                later copy is read with the question in view (Leviathan et al.,
                "Prompt Repetition Improves Non-Reasoning LLMs", arXiv 2512.14982).
batch           Send a question's rotations through one Evaluator call: the
                prefix they share is evaluated once, the rest in one batch, and
                the prefix stays cached for the next question. Batched kernels
                add in a different order, so probabilities move a little (up to
                0.046 on the case sets with gemma-4-E4B, no decision changed).
compact_json    Write JSON in the prompt without spaces or line breaks.
rotate_last     With permute and repeat, rotate the options of the last copy
                only, so the rotations share everything before that last list.
options_once    With repeat, list the options once, at the end. Faster, and less
                accurate: the whole message has to be repeated.
question_first  Put the question before the state in each copy.
fibers          List each choice option this many times in one prompt, in blocks
                of different rotations under distinct letters, and add up the
                probabilities of each option's letters. One prompt stands in for
                the rotations. A list longer than the 62 labels falls back to
                the rotations with permute, and is asked once without it.
fiber_same      With fibers, repeat the blocks in the same order, not rotated.
fiber_map       With fibers, list the options without letters, then map each
                letter to an option name.
runoff          When a choice's readings disagree by more than this, ask its two
                leading options alone, in both orders, and split their mass by
                that answer. 0 turns it off. On JevBench it helped gemma-4-E4B
                (+3 hard items) and hurt gemma-4-26B-A4B (-4): it pays only
                where most of the answers it re-asks are wrong.
temperature     Divide the label logits by this before each softmax. Raw label
                probabilities are too sharp; above 1 softens them.
shrink          Move each answer toward uniform by how far its readings (the
                rotations, or the fiber blocks) disagree: the mean pairwise total
                variation distance between them. The top answer never changes;
                answers the readings disagree on get less confidence.
recheck         Write the first answer back and ask again. The model agrees with
                itself, and the answers got worse.
embedding       The model is an embedding model; answer by cosine similarity
                (`backends/embed.py`).

The Docker image serves `SYSTEM + GUARD` with repeat 2, permute, batch, fibers 2,
fiber_map, shrink and temperature 1.25. The library's own defaults leave them
all off.

Nothing here talks to an engine. This module writes the prompts and reads an
answer out of the label probabilities; getting those probabilities is a
backend's work (`backends/`), so one method serves a local GGUF and a vLLM
endpoint from the same code.
