"""Read the same typed decisions from a vLLM endpoint instead of a local GGUF.

Lichen's method is engine-agnostic: build a prompt that ends where the label goes, read the
softmax over the label tokens of one next-token distribution. Only the way the logits arrive is
llama.cpp-specific. This module gets them over HTTP from vLLM; `method` does the rest, so
Method, variants, rotations, fibers, readings, shrink, disagreement, runoff and confidence are
the same code that serves a GGUF, not a second copy of it.

Two reasons it is worth having:

  * The local server answers one request at a time (see README's "Limits"). vLLM does
    continuous batching, and with --enable-prefix-caching gives for free the shared-prefix
    reuse that --batch hand-rolls. For a sweep over thousands of decisions that serialisation
    is the whole cost.
  * vLLM cannot read GGUF at all (its V1 engine lists GGUF as removed), so this is the only way
    to put the same question to an FP8 or AWQ checkpoint.

Each request names its label tokens in `allowed_token_ids`, and the endpoint must run with
--logprobs-mode processed_logprobs. The log-probabilities then come after the mask, so they are
the softmax over the label tokens alone, and the top-N list holds every label and nothing else.
With a raw mode the top-N is taken over the whole vocabulary, and a confident model ranks its
unlikely labels below other tokens: on gemma-4-26B-A4B, 3 of 6 labels were missing from the top
64. The greedy request applies no temperature, so the processed values are the masked logits
less one constant, which cancels in the softmax over the labels -- provided no penalty moves
them, so the request pins the penalties rather than inherit the server's defaults.

The server needs --max-logprobs >= (options x fibers), at most 62; its default of 20 is too low
for a wide choice. `_probs` still refuses a reply that lacks a label, which would otherwise read
as probability zero. (62 is len(method.LABELS); a raw-mode server fails that check on most wide
choices, which is how a missing --logprobs-mode shows up.)

vLLM is not deterministic across batches: the same request gave label probabilities up to 0.09
apart on gemma-4-26B-A4B, enough to move a borderline answer. VLLM_BATCH_INVARIANT=1 in the
server's environment made two full JevBench runs agree on all 231 items, for ~23% latency.
A launch that serves this backend reproducibly:

    VLLM_BATCH_INVARIANT=1 vllm serve MODEL --enable-prefix-caching \\
      --logprobs-mode processed_logprobs --max-logprobs 64 --max-model-len 32768

`usage.input_tokens` is the full prompt as vLLM counts it. The llama.cpp backend counts only the
tokens it evaluated after its cached prefix, so the two are not comparable as costs.

Not ported: --recheck, whose second round would want the endpoint's own answer written back,
and --embedding. Asked for, they raise rather than be ignored. Nor are the prompts that
llamacpp.render builds per model -- Granite Guardian's criteria, Qwen3Guard's plain ChatML, and
closing a reasoning block a template leaves open (LFM2.5) -- so those models are refused rather
than read with a prompt they were never given (`check_model`). Nothing here needs vLLM
installed: the engine is reached over HTTP, and a `pip install lichen` is the whole dependency.
